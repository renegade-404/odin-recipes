    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced/li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until dissolved; set aside. <br>
            Combine soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a <br>
            saucepan over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer. Slowly whisk in cornstarch <br>
            mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, stirring <br>
            often, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels; arrange in a baking dish. <br> 
            Pour sauce over chicken breasts, coating all sides.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices <br>
            run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read <br>
            at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
