    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in a shallow casserole dish. Pour buttermilk over chicken<br>
            and refrigerate for 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix flour, seasoned salt, and pepper in a large gallon-sized resealable plastic bag.<br>
            Dredge chicken thighs in seasoned flour. Dip back into buttermilk, then coat with panko bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Spray the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange 1/2 of the chicken thighs<br>
            in the basket, making sure none are touching. Spray top of each chicken thigh with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes. Flip the thighs and spray tops of chicken again.<br>
            Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes.<br>
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).<br>
            Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
