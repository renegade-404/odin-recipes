At the end of this course, I will have learned how to properly build my own website and how to manage it. (hopefully)
As the day of 25.02.2025 (cool date!), I have learned how to create a website with basic HTML elements, such as "a" or "p" etc.
Also, I have been able to familiarize myself with Git and CLI a little bit. I can make repositories and copy them to locally manage it.
